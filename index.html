        <h2>Investigation</h2>
        <p><b>Ideas</b><br>
            Some conceived ideas included a running tracker, hydration tracker and calorie tracker. I decided to select the sleep tracker. I will see how sleep length, air quality while sleeping and meditation affect heart rate, memory and perceived happiness. My device will track all these different inputs. 
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Existing solutions</b><br>
            The Fitbit Sense 2 is the best sleep tracker overall according to usnews.com<sup>1</sup>. The Fitbit Sense 2 is a wrist attached watch, detecting heart rate and motion and automatically tracking sleep quality. The Fitbit presents data such as sleep quality score and sleep length.   
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Wellbeing definition</b><br>
            “Wellbeing is present when a person realises their potential, is resilient in dealing with the normal stresses of their life, takes care of their physical wellbeing and has a sense of purpose, connection and belonging to a wider community. It is a fluid way of being and needs nurturing throughout life.” 
        </p>
        
        <p><b>How my project links to wellbeing</b><br>
            Heart rate, memory and perceived happiness are crucial to wellbeing.: 
            <ul>
                <li>
                “an unusually high resting heart rate or low maximum heart rate may signify an increased risk of heart disease or other medical condition.”<sup>4</sup>.  This emphasises the significance of heart rate in wellbeing.  
                </li>
                <li>
                “Without adequate sleep, your brain has a harder time absorbing and recalling new information.”<sup>5</sup>. Worse memory leads to people being less resilient in dealing with the normal stresses of life like schoolwork, work pressure, responsibilities. 
                </li>
                <li>
                “The risk of getting high blood pressure among happy people was 9% lower than among unhappy people.”<sup>8</sup>.  This highlights not only the importance of happiness to emotional wellbeing, but also physical wellbeing. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Survey</b><br>
            I conducted a survey on sleep and the use of sleep trackers. I sent the survey out to students in my school - potential end users. The survey gathered insights into how sleep trackers may impact peoples sleep patterns and wellbeing and understanding of user needs. The results received were very promising: 
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    55% of participants get 7 hours or less sleep - the majority get less than the recommended amount of sleep for teenagers, which is 8 to 10 hours of sleep<sup>7</sup>. 
                </li>
                <li>
                55% believe they do not get enough sleep. 
                </li>
                <li>
                64% believe that their memory is affected by the amount of sleep they get. 
                </li>
                <li>
                73% think that the amount of sleep they get does not affect their heart rate throughout the day. 
                </li>
                <li>
                45% did not know a higher resting heart rate is associated with increased risk of heart disease. 
                </li>
                <li>
                Participants on average rated the air quality in their room as 6.27 out of 10. 
                </li>
                <li>
                73% find bad air quality in their bedroom affects their sleep quality. 
                </li>
                <li>
                73% do not use a device to track their sleep. 
                </li>
                <li>
                55% believe a sleep tracker would help them improve their sleep. 
                </li>
                <li>
                12% of people said they meditate. 
                </li>
                <li>
                60% believe meditation helps with sleep quality. 
                </li>
          </ul>
            These survey results show that a sleep tracker that helps users monitor their sleep duration and educates on the dangers of not getting good quality sleep is needed. 
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Plan and Design</h2>
        <p><b>Basic requirements</b><br>
            <ol>
                <li>
                I will use a microbit for my device - utilising both digital and analogue inputs and outputs. I will use air quality and an accelerometer as analogue inputs, and button ‘A’ and ‘B’ for digital inputs. I will also use the display of the microbit as a digital output and sound as an analogue output. The sleep tracker will automatically start tracking the length of sleep and air quality on user falling asleep. I will also create a heart rate tracker, memory test, perceived happiness entry program and meditation entry program. 
                </li>
                <li>
                The data from the microbit will be sent through radio to another microbit connected to the PC via USB. This data will be processed and validated in Python and sent to CSV files. 
                </li>
                <li>
                I will analyse the data using the mean, minimum and maximum of the data to inform the user of future decisions relating to wellbeing. 
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p><b>Advanced requirements</b><br>
            <ol>
            <li>
              I will create a dataset programmatically through Python, basing my model off this dataset. I will use linear regression using the scikit-learn library. My model will calculate heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness based off sleep length, air quality average while sleeping and if they have meditated that day. It will be capable of answering four ‘what if’ type questions. The questions will be: 
                <ul>
                <li>
                What if my sleep length, air quality while sleeping and have I meditated that day is at baseline, what will my heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness be? 
                </li>
                <li>
                (Assuming I don’t meditate most days)  What if my sleep length and air quality while sleeping is at baseline and I have meditated that day, what will my heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness be? 
                </li>
                <li>
                What if my sleep length and have I meditated that day is at baseline and air quality while sleeping is 50% better than baseline, what will my heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness be? 
                </li>
                <li>
                What if air quality while sleeping and have I meditated that day is at baseline and sleep length is 50% better than baseline, what will my heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness be? 
                </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                My what if questions have three parameters. There are 2 floats, sleep length and air quality and there is 1 boolean ,have I meditated that day. 
            </li>
            <li>
                My device will display bar charts comparing the results of the ‘what if’ questions. My device will also display in a line graph the users progress in sleep length, air quality while sleeping, meditation, heart rate, memory and perceived happiness. 
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    
        <p><b>Technologies used</b><br>
            I will use/need
            <ul>
            <li>
                A PC to process and graph the data being sent. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Python. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Thonny to help me write the code efficiently. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A graphing library (matplotlib). 
            </li>
            <li>
                A modelling library (scikit-learn). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Two microbits, one used to log data to the PC, and one used for the sleep tracker, heart rate tracker, memory test, perceived happiness entry and meditation entry. They will communicate through radio. 
            </li>
            <li>
                A USB cable to connect microbit to PC. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Kitronik Air Quality Board to track air quality and use batteries to power microbit remotely.  
            </li>
            <li>
                CSV files to store data. 
            </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p><b>Approach taken</b><br>
            My project will utilise the Agile approach as opposed to Waterfall approach. Agile allows for more flexibility, adaptability and iteration enabling identification of issues early in development process. 
                
            <br><br>
            
            I decided to use modular design over top-down design, as modular design simplifies the project down into easier to manage modules, modular design allows me to use the modules of code in other parts of the project and the modules are small, so there will be less bugs and they will be easier to fix.

                <li>
                  I created a unit test to confirm that my sleep tracker was displaying the correct sleep length. My code that tracks the time of the sleep length is:

                <img src="images/sleepTrackerCode.png", alt="Sleep tracker code", width="800">
                <li>
                    The while loop stops when the acceleration of the microbit gets too much, meaning the user is awake. Before the while loop, I set startTime to the running time in milliseconds and I set the variable ‘i’ to 0. I wanted the air quality reading to be sent every 10 mins. In the while loop, if ‘i’ equals 0, the code sends the air quality index through radio. This while loop loops every 0.5 seconds, so whenever I send an air quality reading (i.e. when ‘i' equals 0), I set ‘i’ to 60 * 10 * 2. This means it takes 10 mins for ‘i’ to come back to being 0. After this while loop is finished I minus the startTime from the current running time and divide by 1,000 to get the value of sleep length in seconds. 
                </li>
                <li>

                <li>
                    Since the while loop loops every 0.5 seconds, I changed a variable ‘sleepLengthUnitTest’ accordingly by 0.5 every loop. I then sent both the original sleep length value and the unit tested sleep length value. This unit test confirmed to me that my sleep length value coming out of the code was correct.

                <li>
                    I used scikit-learn to create a linear regression model, accounting for three parameters (sleep length, air quality average while sleeping and meditation that day) and generates three outputs (heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness). 
                </li>
                <li>
                    A difficulty encountered and overcome was a recurring Error. I realised my data was not formatted correctly for the train_test_split function. sleepLength, airQualityAverage and haveMeditated are lists that are part of my training data used for my model. My training data list used initially was formatted incorrectly in the form [sleepLength, airQualityAverage, haveMeditated]. Each parameter was stored as separate lists, rather than each day’s data being grouped together as a single item. I overcame this problem by reformatting the data. The data needed to be formatted so that each day's data had its own item, i.e. the list must be in the form [[sleepLength[0], airQualityAverage[0], haveMeditated[0]], ........ , [sleepLength[29], airQualityAverage[29], haveMeditated[29]]. This solved the problem.

                    This piece of code reformats the data so that it is acceptable for the train_test_split function as explained above. The code loops through each list and appends the corresponding item of sleepLength, airQualityAverage and haveMeditated to the data list.

                <p>
                    I used the scikit-learn library to create my linear regression model. I first initialised the linear regression model. I then, initialised the variable ‘y’ to heart rate which will be my output. I used the train_test_split function to split the data into training and test subsets. I then used the fit function to train the machine learning model on the training data. Next, I put the parameters of the function (sleepLengthInput, airQualityAverageInput, haveMeditatedInput) into the model to predict the heart rate. I print out the predicted heart rate and I return the value.

I set haveMeditatedInput to True if the input is ‘Y’ and I set the haveMeditatedInput to False if the input is ‘N’. I then use the predict functions explained above to calculate heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness.

                <li>
                   Using a microbit, I successfully developed my device to utilise both digital and analogue inputs and outputs. The sleep tracker automatically tracked the length of sleep and air quality on user falling asleep. I also successfully created and tested a heart rate tracker, memory test, perceived happiness entry program and meditation entry program.  
                </li>
                <li>
                   The data from the microbit was transmitted successfully by radio and USB, processed and validated in Python and sent to CSV files.

                   The dataset was created programmatically through Python, and I developed my model from this dataset. Linear regression using the scikit-learn library was utilised. My developed model successfully calculated heart rate, memory level and perceived happiness based off sleep length, air quality average while sleeping and whether the user has meditated that day. Four critical ‘what if’ type questions and analysis of responses were devised/incorporated into the model to inform the user.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Three parameters were included in my ‘what if’ questions - 2 floats (sleep length and air quality) and 1 boolean ‘have I meditated that day'. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bar charts comparing the results of the ‘what if’ questions were produced as were line graphs illustrating the users progress in sleep length, air quality while sleeping, meditation, heart rate, memory and perceived happiness.

            The system developed measures and tracks the critical parameters of sleep length, air quality, and meditation and calculates heart rate, memory and perceived happiness. This information is passed on to the user in graphical user-friendly form and advice is clearly given, how to improve environmental conditions and behavioural guidance.

                <li>
                    I could use a more accurate heart rate sensor rather than relying on the user to track their own pulse.
